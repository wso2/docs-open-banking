### OpenAPI based extensions

With the release of Open Banking 4.0, it has introduced OpenAPI based extensions such that the toolkit developer can 
implement Open Banking specification requirements in their preferred programming language. And the custom developed 
extensions can be deployed externally and tested seperatly without restarting the WSO2 servers.The OpenAPI extension 
can be found from [here](../references/accelerator-extensions-api.md).
