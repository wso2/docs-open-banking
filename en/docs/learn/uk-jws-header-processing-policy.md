### UK JWS Header Processing Policy

UK JWS Header Processing Policy is a policy designed to be engaged in the request flow of any request that requires the JWS signature header to be validated prior to an API resource call and to be appended a JWS signature header in the response. This is a Open Banking UK specific implementation and can be used as a reference to develop custom JWS requirements. It will perform the below tasks.

- Validates the JWS signature header as mentioned in the UK specification
- Appends a JWS signature header in the response as mentioned in the UK specification

Create an API Level Policy by following the [Creating API Level Policy](../learn/create-policies.md) and add to all API resources which require JWS request header processing. Find the details to create the policy below.
