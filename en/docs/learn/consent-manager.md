After a certain period, bank customers may need to view, update, or revoke consents they have granted to API consumer 
applications to access account data. **Consent Manager** is an application in WSO2 Open Banking that supports all these
requirements and manages consents.

!!! tip
    You can use the [/admin endpoint in Consent REST API](../references/consent-rest-api.md#/Admin) 
    to retrieve consent details and customize Consent Manager. For example,

    ``` 
    curl -X GET "https://localhost:9446/api/fs/consent/admin/search?consentIDs=12345&clientIDs=5678&consentTypes=accounts&consentStatuses=authorized&userIDs=user1&fromTime=12012020&toTime=12012021&limit=10&offset=0" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization Basic <TOKEN>>"
    ```

!!! note
    - Bank officers with the `CustomerCareOfficerRole` role and bank customers can access the Consent Manager.  
    - Customer Care Officers have privileges such as Advanced Search options and the ability to view the consents of all bank customers.

## Configuring Consent Manager

1. Open the `<IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps/consentmgr/runtime-config.js` file.

2. Follow the below instructions.

    - If the Consent Manager Portal is deployed on the WSO2 Identity Server, use the default configuration given below.
        ```
        window.env = {
            `USE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS: true,
            SERVER_URL: 'https://localhost:9446',
            SPEC: 'Default',
            TENANT_DOMAIN: 'carbon.super',
            NUMBER_OF_CONSENTS: 20,
            VERS`ION: '3.0.0'
        };
        ```

    -  If you are using a different server instance for the Identity Server, update the above configurations as follows.
        a. Set the USE_DEFAULT_CONFIGS parameter to false.
        b. Update the SERVER_URL parameter with the URL of the Identity Server.

3. Open the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and update the configurations.

    | Configuration              | Description |
    | -------------------------- | ----------- |
    | client_id                  | The Consumer Key of the application created. |
    | client_secret              | The Consumer Secret of the application created. |
    | identity_server_base_url   | The hostname of the Identity Server. |
    | application_name_param     | This is the parameter name to extract the consumer application name to display in the consent manager portal. The value should be stored during application creation to retrieve here.|
    | application_logo_uri_param | This is the parameter name to extract the consumer application logo to display in the consent manager portal. The value should be stored during application creation to retrieve here. |

    For example,
    ```
    [financial_services.consent.portal.client_credentials]
    client_id="2zB5s9wGHWVwmlrvHdWa6Mwc4vsa"
    client_secret="cqblprasAniVfi02IXGFvp8VREAa"

    [financial_services.consent.portal.params]
    identity_server_base_url="https://localhost:9446"
    application_name_param="client_name"
    application_logo_uri_param="software_logo_uri"
    ```
