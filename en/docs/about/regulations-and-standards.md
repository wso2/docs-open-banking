Regulations and specifications are enforced by the authorities to standardise the open banking requirements and 
evaluate the open banking compliance in their region/country.

## Open banking regulations
Open banking regulations provide a policy and legislative framework to help banks and API consumers deliver the 
benefits of open banking. 

- The first known open banking regulation is the **Payment Service Directive** in Europe. Administered by the European 
Commission (Directorate General Internal Market) regulates payment services and payment service providers throughout 
the European Union and European Economic Area (EEA). PSD1 came into force in 2007 followed by the PSD2 in 2015.

- The Competition and Market Authority formed the **Open Banking Implementation Entity** in the UK. The Open Banking 
Implementation Entity adopted the PSD2 and issued its first version of the open banking standard in 2017. It 
specified how banks should allow an API consumer to access customer’s information and request payments with the 
customer’s consent.

- The Berlin Group consists of almost 40 banks, associations and Payment Service Providers across the European Union. 
They have defined a common API standard called NextGenPSD2 for the use cases specified in PSD2. Based on the PSD2 and 
European Banking Authority - Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) requirements, the Berlin Group has worked on detailed 
Access to Account (XS2A) Framework including implementation details for open banking named as **NextGenPSD2XS2A**.

- **Consumer Data Right** in Australia is a right provided by law under the Treasury Laws Amendment 
(Consumer Data Right)  Act in 2019 to give Australians greater control over their data. It empowers consumers to 
choose to share their data with API consumers only for the purposes that they have authorized.

- **Fintech law** in Mexico promotes data sharing as well as transparency among banks and subholding companies 
(example: broker-dealers, money exchangers, credit unions, popular, and community financial entities). The Fintech law 
defines guidelines for the regulated entities on the types of information and how to share them. Comisión Nacional 
Bancaria y de Valores, The Embassy of the United Kingdom, the FinTech Hub, C Minds, ODI and the Government of the 
Republic are involved in the regulation.

- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published the **Open API Framework** in 2018 to provide a secure, controlled, 
and convenient operating environment to financial institutions and third parties. It expects the banks and third 
parties to work together and build innovative banking services offering a better customer experience. The framework 
has a phased approach. 
 
- The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provided a legal framework for open banking in 2018. MAS introduced 
[APIX](https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/fintech/api-exchange) for the banks to open up their data and services 
encouraging openness among both the financial institutions and the API consumers.

- Following the footsteps of the UK and Australia, New Zealand issued a government backed pilot plan in 2018 to design 
and develop open banking into their infrastructure. In 2019, as a result of the pilot plan, a 
new [API service](https://www.apicentre.paymentsnz.co.nz/) was developed to enable payment initiation and account 
information. 

Likewise, Nigeria, India, Turkey, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Columbia have 
already started drafting open banking regulations for their countries.
