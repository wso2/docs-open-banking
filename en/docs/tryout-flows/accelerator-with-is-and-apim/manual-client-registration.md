### Step 2: Sign in to the Developer Portal as the TPP

1. Now, sign in to the [Developer portal](https://<APIM_HOST>:9443/devportal) as the TPP.

2. Enter the username and the password you entered when signing up as a TPP.

3. Click Continue. Now, you are on the home page of the Developer Portal.

### Step 3: Create an application

1. In the Developer Portal, go to the Applications tab. ![applications_tab](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/applications-tab.png)

2. Click **ADD NEW APPLICATION**. [applications_tab](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/create-new-application.png)  

3. Enter the following application details.  ![applications_details](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/enter-application-details.png)

4. Click **SAVE**. The Developer Portal displays the created application as follows: ![created_application](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/created-application.png)

 
The application created via the Developer Portal allows you to observe statistics of APIs, subscribe to APIs, and access the subscribed APIs.

### Step 4: Subscribe to API

1. Go to the APIs tab in the Developer portal.![click_apis](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/click-apis.png)

2. Select the API. ![select_api](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/select-api.png)

3. Go to **Subscriptions** at the bottom of the API and select **SUBSCRIBE**.

4. Select **your application** from the drop-down list then set the **Throttling Policy** and click **SUBSCRIBE**. Once subscribed, the application can access all the supported services of the API resources.

### Step 5: Generate keys

The TPP application requires a Client ID (Consumer Key) to access the subscribed API.

1. Go to the **Applications** tab in the Developer Portal.

2. From the application list, select your application, which has subscribed to the API.

3. Select **Production Keys** > **OAuth2 Tokens or Sandbox Keys** > **OAuth2 Tokens** according to the type of key you require:
    a. Production Keys: Generates access tokens in the production environment.
    b. Sandbox Keys: Generates access tokens in the sandbox environment. 
     ![generate_keys](../../assets/img/learn/mcr/generate-keys.png)

4. Provide the requested information as defined below:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Grant Types | Determine the credentials that are used to generate the access token. <ul> <li> Code: Relates to the authorisation code grant type and is applicable when consuming the API as a user. **It is mandatory to select the code grant type for regulatory applications.** </li> <li> Client Credentials: Relates to the client credentials grant type and is applicable when consuming the API as an application. </li> <li> Refresh Token: To renew an expired access token. </li> </ul> |
    | Callback URL | The URL used by the TPP to receive the authorization code sent from the bank. The authorisation code can be used later to generate an OAuth2 access token. <br/> **This is a mandatory field for the authorization code grant type.** |
    | Enable PKCE | Enable if you want to enable PKCE support for your application |
    | Support PKCE Plain text | Enable if you want to enable PKCE Plain Text support for your application |
    | Application Certificate | This is the content of the application certificate (.PEM). For Regulatory applications, it is mandatory to use an application certificate. Use [Signing Certificate](../../assets/attachments/signing-certs/obsigning.pem) for testing porpose. |
    | Regulatory Application | The type of application. If your application complies with the Open Banking Regulation, it is a Regulatory application. |
