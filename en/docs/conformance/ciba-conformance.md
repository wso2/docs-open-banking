#Running FAPI - CIBA Conformance Suite

!!! note
    WSO2 Open Banking 3.0.0 supports OpenID Conformance Suite v5.2.0. 

The OpenID conformance suite consists of security standards that are defined by the OpenID Foundation (OIDF). It 
maximizes the security of the APIs, providing robust data flow in Open Banking. An advantage of using OIDF security 
standards is that the Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP) can attest affiliated payment service 
providers through a self-certification process.

WSO2 Open Banking complies with conformance suites that can be configured by the ASPSP. The following 
configurations guide you to set up the WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator according to the **OpenID Conformance Suite : 
CIBA profile**.

## Configure certificates

To run this conformance suite, you need 2 different signing, transport certificates and corresponding 
Software Statement Assertions (SSAs).

!!! note
    Generate new keystores and exchange certificates by following the 
    [Exchanging certificates](../install-and-setup/setting-up-servers.md#exchanging-the-certificates) documentation.

## Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters

1. Open the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2. Add the following configurations:

    ``` toml
    [transport.https.sslHostConfig.properties]
    ciphers="TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
    ```

3. Add the `PreferredCiphers` configurations under the `[transport.passthru_https.listener.parameters]` tag:

    ``` toml
    [transport.passthru_https.listener.parameters]
    PreferredCiphers = "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
    ```

4. Restart the API Manager.

## Configure applications

The conformance suite has to run from the perspective of 2 clients. Therefore, two applications are required. Follow the
steps and create applications:

1. Create 2 applications using [Dynamic Client Registration](../learn/dynamic-client-registration-try-out.md) under
   the same API Consumer/Third Party Provider (TPP).

    !!! note
        For the application certificate, use the client certificates (public key) signed by the root CA/Issuer 
        CA (prior acquired or generated). For example, `tpp.com.crt`.

2. Generate production keys and take note of the consumer key and secret.

## Configure well-known endpoint 

1. Download and extract the [well-known-config-resources.zip](../assets/attachments/well-known-config-resources.zip).
2. Go to the `well-known-config-resources` directory.
3. Copy the `auth.server.info-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file into the `<IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib` directory.
4. Copy the `openid-configuration.json` file into the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity` directory. 
5. Update the values in `openid-configuration.json` according to your setup. 
6. Update the `keystore.json` file with the authorization server keys and client application keys generated for 
   [both applications](#configure-applications).
7. Copy the `keystore.json` file into the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity` directory.
8. Open the `<IS_HOME>repository/resources/conf/templates/repository/conf/tomcat/web.xml.j2` file and register the 
   following servlets. Add the following elements before the `</webapp>` tag.

    ``` xml
    <servlet>
           <servlet-name>Discovery</servlet-name>
           <servlet-class>auth.server.info.Discovery</servlet-class>
       </servlet>
     
       <servlet-mapping>
           <servlet-name>Discovery</servlet-name>
           <url-pattern>/token/.well-known/openid-configuration</url-pattern>
       </servlet-mapping>
     
       <servlet>
           <servlet-name>Keystore</servlet-name>
           <servlet-class>auth.server.info.Keystore</servlet-class>
       </servlet>
     
       <servlet-mapping>
           <servlet-name>Keystore</servlet-name>
           <url-pattern>/token/keystore</url-pattern>
       </servlet-mapping>
    ```
   
9. Restart the Identity Server and API Manager.
10. Go to the following links and see the changes:

    ``` 
    https://<IS_HOST>:9446/oauth2/token/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```
    
    ``` 
    https://<IS_HOST>:9446/oauth2/token/keystore
    ```

## Set up CIBA automated approval endpoint

The conformance suite requires a custom endpoint to mock the user approval process in the CIBA flow. To achieve this, a
simple flask server can be used. 

!!! tip
    A sample implementation is available
    <a href="../../assets/attachments/automated-endpoint.zip" download>here</a>.

## Run the conformance suite

!!! tip "Before you begin:"
    [Set up the CIBA flow](../learn/ciba-set-up-flow.md)

### Configure conformance suite

This section describes how to build the conformance suite to identify the configuration and application settings.

1. Download the sample JSON configuration file available <a href="../../assets/attachments/ciba-conformance-config.json" download>here</a>.

    - Update the values according to the [applications you created](#configure-applications).
    - The `kid` value should be the specific kid value of the corresponding signing certificate in the JWKS.
    - The `ciba_approval_endpoint` value should be the custom endpoint configured in the 
      [Set up CIBA automated approval endpoint](##set-up-ciba-automated-approval-endpoint) section.

2. Fill in the following values in the `Server` section:

    | Key | Value                                                                  |
